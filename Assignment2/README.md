Encapsulation: Used private variables (e.g., __LBS_TO_KG) to protect internal data.

PEP 8 Compliance: Followed standard Python naming conventions for classes and methods.

Modularity: Separated the program into BMICalculator.py (logic) and main.py (interface).

Reflection
I learned to use OOP to make my code more organized and professional. By hiding the conversion math inside a class, I created a program that is easier to maintain and reuse. Following PEP 8 standards ensures my code meets industry expectations.
