PEP 8 style guide

VS Code Python extension

BMI formula reference

python compiler

In this assignment I practiced writing professional Python code using PEP 8 coding standards. I learned how to structure programs using functions, docstrings, and clean variable naming. I also used Git for version control and VS Code as my IDE. This helped me understand how real-world developers write readable and maintainable code rather than just making programs work.

Assignment #3

In this assignment, I practiced using properties in object-oriented programming instead of regular calculation methods. I stored height and weight inside a class and used properties to automatically convert units and calculate BMI. The BMI value is read-only, which helps protect the data and demonstrates encapsulation. Using properties made the program cleaner and easier to use because the calculations happen internally. This approach will help me write more organized and maintainable code for future projects and my career in technology. I used the Wikiversity lesson, Python documentation, and GitHub while completing this work.

Assignment#4

In this assignment, I extended the BMI calculator to use object-oriented programming with properties and focused on input validation, parameter validation, assertions, and exception handling. The BMI class now automatically calculates BMI from the stored height and weight values, and all properties validate that only correct data types and ranges are accepted. The main program validates user input and handles exceptions gracefully, terminating the program if invalid input is entered. Assertions are used to confirm assumptions, such as the user’s choice of units.

Through this assignment, I learned how to make programs more robust, maintainable, and professional. I now understand the importance of validating both user input and class parameters, using exceptions to handle errors, and using assertions to verify program assumptions. This knowledge will help me write reliable and well-structured code for future projects, coursework, and my career in software development or cybersecurity.

ASSIGNMMENT#5

In this assignment, I developed a BMI calculation class and implemented a comprehensive suite of unit tests. Through this process, I learned how automated testing ensures code reliability by catching edge cases—like zero height—before they cause system failures. I also gained experience with code coverage tools to verify that every line of logic was executed during testing. I intend to use this "test-driven" approach in future projects to minimize debugging time and write more professional, bug-free code. All spelling and grammar have been verified using Grammarly, and the source code follows standard documentation practices.
