the resources that i used,

Python docs

PEP 8 style guide

VS Code Python extension

BMI formula reference

python compiler

In this assignment I practiced writing professional Python code using PEP 8 coding standards. I learned how to structure programs using functions, docstrings, and clean variable naming. I also used Git for version control and VS Code as my IDE. This helped me understand how real-world developers write readable and maintainable code rather than just making programs work.
