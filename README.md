the resources that i used,

Python docs

PEP 8 style guide

VS Code Python extension

BMI formula reference

python compiler

In this assignment I practiced writing professional Python code using PEP 8 coding standards. I learned how to structure programs using functions, docstrings, and clean variable naming. I also used Git for version control and VS Code as my IDE. This helped me understand how real-world developers write readable and maintainable code rather than just making programs work.

Assignment #3

In this assignment, I practiced using properties in object-oriented programming instead of regular calculation methods. I stored height and weight inside a class and used properties to automatically convert units and calculate BMI. The BMI value is read-only, which helps protect the data and demonstrates encapsulation. Using properties made the program cleaner and easier to use because the calculations happen internally. This approach will help me write more organized and maintainable code for future projects and my career in technology. I used the Wikiversity lesson, Python documentation, and GitHub while completing this work.
