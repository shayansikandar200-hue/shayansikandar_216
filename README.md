the resources that i used,

Python docs

PEP 8 style guide

VS Code Python extension

BMI formula reference

python compiler

In this assignment I practiced writing professional Python code using PEP 8 coding standards. I learned how to structure programs using functions, docstrings, and clean variable naming. I also used Git for version control and VS Code as my IDE. This helped me understand how real-world developers write readable and maintainable code rather than just making programs work.

Assignment #3

In this assignment, I practiced using properties in object-oriented programming instead of regular calculation methods. I stored height and weight inside a class and used properties to automatically convert units and calculate BMI. The BMI value is read-only, which helps protect the data and demonstrates encapsulation. Using properties made the program cleaner and easier to use because the calculations happen internally. This approach will help me write more organized and maintainable code for future projects and my career in technology. I used the Wikiversity lesson, Python documentation, and GitHub while completing this work.

Assignment#4

In this assignment, I learned how to add validation, exception handling, and assertions to an object-oriented Python program. I extended the BMI calculator to use properties that validate input for type and range, ensuring that only valid height and weight values are accepted. The BMI property is read-only and automatically calculates BMI from the stored values. In the main program, user inputs are validated, and exceptions are caught to terminate the program gracefully if invalid data is entered. Assertions are used to confirm assumptions about user choices. This project helped me understand how to make programs more robust, reliable, and professional, which is important for both my coursework and future career in technology. I used Python documentation, Wikiversity lessons on validation and properties, and GitHub for version control while completing this assignment.
